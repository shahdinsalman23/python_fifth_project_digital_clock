# Python Digital Clock

This project is a **Digital Clock** built using Python's `tkinter` library, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time clock functionality. The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and also shows the current date in a user-friendly format.

## Project Overview

The digital clock is designed to:
- Display the time in `HH:MM:SS AM/PM` format.
- Show the current date in `MM/DD/YY` format.
- Update the time and date every second for real-time accuracy.
- Provide a simple and clean user interface with customizable font, background, and text colors.

## Features

- **Real-Time Time Display**: The clock updates itself every second to reflect the current time.
- **Date Display**: It also shows the current date below the time.
- **Customizable GUI**: You can easily modify the background, text colors, and font size to fit your preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used to build this project.
- **Tkinter Library**: Provides the GUI framework for the digital clock.
